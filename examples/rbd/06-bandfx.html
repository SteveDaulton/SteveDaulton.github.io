<h1 align=center>Multiple Band Effects Tutorial</h1>

<p align=center>This page describes how to use the bandfx library in Nyquist.

<h2>What does it do?</h2>

<p>The idea is very simple: separate the incoming signal into different
frequency bands. Apply an effect to each frequency band. For example, apply a
delay, with longer delays at higher frequencies. Then sum the outputs of the
effects. In the delay example, the result will be something like a filter sweep
-- the low frequencies come out first, followed by increasingly higher
frequencies.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Frequency bands are separated using Nyquist's <tt>reson</tt> filter.
Although reson is not perfect for this job, it has the nice feature that there
is a complementary areson filter that returns everything removed by reson. We
split off the lowest frequency band with reson, then apply areson to get the
remainder of the signal. We pass this through another reson tuned to the second
band and use another areson to get the remainder. Using a series of filters,
we pull off all the band except for the last one, which is just whatever is
left over.</p>

<p>The function separate-into-bands constructs an array of frequency bands.
The function reconstruct-from-bands sums an array of frequency bands back into
a single channel. Different functions apply effects to the frequency band
representation. Consult the code (see 
<a href="06-bandfx/bandfx.lsp.html">bandfx.lsp</a> for details). You can use
the code as a template for creating your own multiple band effects.</p>

<h2>How can I use it?</h2>

<pre>   > (load "bandfx")</pre>

<pre>   > (f2)</pre>

<pre>   > (f3)</pre>

<pre>   > (f4)</pre>

<pre>   > (f5)</pre>

<p>- Sound examples: 
<a href="06-bandfx/f2.ogg">f2.ogg</a> -
<a href="06-bandfx/f3.ogg">f3.ogg</a> -
<a href="06-bandfx/f4.ogg">f4.ogg</a> -
<a href="06-bandfx/f5.ogg">f5.ogg</a>
</p>

<p>The commands shown above will play some examples that are included in
<a href="06-bandfx/bandfx.lsp.html">bandfx.lsp</a>. You can read the code for a
description of the functions and to see examples of their use. The functions
are also described in the
<a href="../../manual/home.html">Nyquist Reference Manual</a> (see "multiple
band effects" in the index).</p>

<p>The manual also describes some ways this library might be extended. Please
contribute some examples if you find these effects useful.</p>
