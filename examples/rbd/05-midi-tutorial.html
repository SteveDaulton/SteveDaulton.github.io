<h1 align=center>Midi Tutorial</h1>

<p>Nyquist can read and write midi files. Midi files are read into and written
from a special XLisp data type called a <tt>SEQ</tt>, which is short for
&quot;sequence&quot;. (This is not part of standard XLisp, but rather part of
Nyquist.) Nyquist can examine the contents of a <tt>SEQ</tt> type, modify
the <tt>SEQ</tt> by adding or deleting Midi notes and other messages.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Nyquist can use the data in a
<tt>SEQ</tt> type along with a sound behavior to generate sound. In other
words, Nyquist can become a Midi synthesizer.</p>

<h2>The <tt>SEQ</tt> Type</h2>

<p>To create a <tt>SEQ</tt> data object:</p>

<pre>
   <b>&gt; </b>(setf my-seq (seq-create))
   <b>#&lt;SEQ:0x7a6f60&gt;
   &gt; </b>(type-of my-seq)
   <b>SEQ
   &gt;</b>
</pre>

<h2>Reading a Midi File</h2>

<p>Once you have a sequence, you can read Midi data into it from a file. You do
this in three steps. First, you open the file in binary mode (using 
<tt>open-binary</tt>, a Nyquist extension to XLisp). Then you read from the
file. Finally, you (normally) close the file.</p>

<pre>
   (setf midi-file (open-binary &quot;demo.mid&quot;))
   (seq-read-smf my-seq midi-file)
   (close midi-file)
</pre>

<p>The <a href="05-midi-tutorial/demo.mid">demo.mid</a> midi file can be
downloaded from here by right-click - save target as...</p>

<h2>Writing a Midi File</h2>

<p>A sequence can be written to a file. First you open the file as a binary
output file; then you write it; then you close it.</p>

<pre>
   (setf midi-file (open-binary &quot;copy.mid&quot; :direction :output))
   (seq-write-smf my-seq midi-file)
   (close midi-file)
</pre>

<p>The result will not be a bit-for-bit copy of the original Midi file because
the <tt>SEQ</tt> representation is not a complete representation of the Midi
data. For example, the Midi file can contain headers and meta-data that is not
captured by Nyquist. Nevertheless, the resulting Midi file should sound the
same if you play it with a sequencer or Midi file player.</p>

<h2>Writing a Text Representation</h2>

<p>One very handy feature of the <tt>SEQ</tt> datatype is that it was
originally developed for a text-based representation of files called the Adagio
Score Language, or just &quot;Adagio.&quot; You can write an Adagio file from a
sequence by opening a text file and calling <tt>seq-write</tt>.</p>

<pre>
   (setf gio-file (open &quot;copy.gio&quot; :direction :output))
   (seq-write my-seq gio-file)
   (close gio-file)
</pre>

<p>The basic format of the Adagio file is pretty intuitive, but you can find
the full description in the CMU Midi Toolkit manual or in a chapter of the
Nyquist manual, including the online version in HTML.</p>

<h2>Reading an Adagio File</h2>

<p>Because Adagio is text, you can easily edit them or compose your own Adagio
file. You should be aware that Adagio supports numerical parameters, where
pitch and duration are just numbers, <em>and symbolic parameter, </em>where a
pitch might be <tt>Bf4</tt> (for B-flat above middle-C) and a duration might be
<tt>QT</tt> (for a quarter note triplet). Symbolic parameters are especially
convenient for manual entry of data. Once you have an Adagio file, you can
create a sequence from it in Nyquist:</p>

<pre>
   (setf seq-2 (seq-create))
   (setf gio-file (open &quot;demo.gio&quot;))
   (seq-read seq-2 gio-file)
   (close gio-file)
</pre>

<h2>Adding Notes to a <code>SEQ</code> Type</h2>

<p>Although not originally intended for this purpose, XLisp and Nyquist form a
powerful language for generating Midi files. These can then be played using a
Midi synthesizer or using Nyquist, as will be illustrated later.</p>

<p>To add notes to a sequence, you call <tt>seq-insert-note</tt> as illustrated
in this routine, called <tt>midinote</tt>. Since <tt>seq-insert-note</tt>
requires integer parameters, with time in milliseconds, <tt>midinote</tt>
performes some conversions and limiting to keep data in range:</p>

<pre>
   (defun midinote (seq time dur voice pitch vel)
     (setf time (round (* time 1000)))
     (setf dur (round (* dur 1000)))
     (setf pitch (round pitch))
     (setf vel (round vel))
     (seq-insert-note seq time 0 (1+ voice) pitch dur vel))
</pre>

<p>Now, let's add some notes to a sequence:</p>

<pre>
   (defun test ()
     (setf *seq* (seq-create))
     (midinote *seq* 0.0 1.0 1 c4 100)
     (midinote *seq* 1.0 0.5 1 d4 100)
     (midinote *seq* 2.0 0.8 1 a4 100)
     (setf seqfile (open-binary &quot;test.mid&quot; :direction :output))
     (seq-write-smf *seq* seqfile)
     (close seqfile))
</pre>

<h2>A Larger Example</h2>

<p>This example illustrates the creation of random note onset times using the
Poisson distribution. One way to generate this distribution, as seen here, is
to create uniformly distributed random times, and then sort these. The function
that creates times and then quantizes them to 24ths of a beat is shown here.
The <tt>len</tt> parameter is the number of times, and the <tt>average-ioi</tt>
parameter is the average inter-onset-interval, the average time interval
between two adjacent times:</p>

<pre>
   ;; create list of random times and sort it
   ;; dur in ms.
   (defun poisson-gen (len average-ioi)
     (let ((dur (* len average-ioi)) poisson-list)
       (dotimes (i len)
	        (push (* dur (random 10000) 0.0001) 
                      poisson-list))
       (setf poisson-list (sort poisson-list #'&lt;))
       (display &quot;initial list&quot; poisson-list)
       ;; map list to 24ths:
       (setf poisson-list
             (quantize-times-to-24ths poisson-list)) ))
</pre>

<p>We add a few functions to help express time in terms of beats: </p>

<pre>
   (defun set-tempo (tempo)
     (setf qtr (/ 60.0 tempo))
     (setf 8th (* qtr 0.5))
     (setf half (* qtr 2))
     (setf whole (* qtr 4))
     (setf 16th (* qtr 0.25)))
</pre>

<pre>
   (if (not (boundp 'qtr)) (set-tempo 100))
</pre>

<pre>
   (defun quantize-times-to-24ths (list)
     (mapcar #'quantize-time-to-24ths list))
</pre>

<pre>
   (defun quantize-time-to-24ths (time)
     (* (/ qtr 24.0)
        (round (* 24 (/ time qtr)))))
</pre>

<p>Now, let's create Midi notes using Poisson-based onset times: </p>

<pre>
   (defun melody (seq onsets)
     (dolist (onset onsets)
       (midinote seq onset 16th 1 (+ 48 (random 24)) 100)))
</pre>

<pre>
   (defun poisson-melody ()
     (setf *seq* (seq-create))
     (melody *seq* (poisson-gen 50 8th)) ;; adds notes to *seq*
     (setf seqfile (open-binary &quot;pois.mid&quot; :direction :output))
     (seq-write-smf *seq* seqfile)
     (close seqfile))
</pre>

<p>After evaluating <code>(poisson-melody)</code>, you can play the file
&quot;pois.mid&quot; to hear the result. The times are quantized to 24th notes
at a tempo of 100, so you can even use a notation editor to display the result
in common music notation.</p>

<h2>Synthesizing a Midi File</h2>

<p>To synthesize sound from a Midi file, use the <code>seq-midi</code> control
construct. This behavior reads the data in the <code>seq</code> object and for
each note, creates an instance of the behavior you provide. You will need an
instrument, so let's define a simple FM instrument to play the notes of the
Midi data:</p>

<pre>
   (defun fm-note (p)
     (mult (pwl 0.01 1 .5 1 1)
           (fmosc p
                  (mult (step-to-hz p)
                        (pwl 0.01 6 0.5 4 1)
                        (osc p)))))
</pre>

<p>Now let's use <tt>fm-note</tt> to play the previously defined
<tt>poisson-melody</tt>, which was saved in the variable <tt>*seq*</tt>: </p>

<pre>
   (play (seq-midi *seq* (note (chan pitch vel) (a-note pitch))))
</pre>

<p>The <tt>seq-midi</tt> construct automatically uses time transformations to
place notes at the proper time and to stretch them to the indicated duration.
In addition, it sets the <tt>chan</tt>, <tt>pitch</tt>, and <tt>vel</tt>
parameters according to the Midi data before invoking your behavior. In this
simple example, we ignored <tt>chan</tt> and <tt>vel</tt>, but we used
<tt>pitch</tt> to get the right pitch. You might write a more complicated
behavior that uses <tt>chan</tt> to select different synthesis algorithms
according to the Midi channel. </p>

<p>The syntax for the <tt>seq-midi</tt> construct may be a little confusing.
The symbol <tt>note</tt> appears to be a function call, but it is not. It is
really there to say that the following parameter list and behavior expression
apply to Midi notes. There can be other terms for other Midi messages, e.g.</p>

<pre>
   (seq-midi my-seq
     (note (chan pitch velocity) (my-note pitch velocity))
     (ctrl (chan control value) (...))
     (bend (chan value) (...))
     (touch (chan value) (...))
     (prgm (chan value) (setf (aref my-prgm chan) value))
</pre>

<h2>Examining <tt>SEQ</tt> Data</h2>

<p>In the lib folder of the standard Nyquist installation, there is a file
called <tt>midishow.lsp</tt>. f you load this, you can call some functions that
help you examine <tt>SEQ</tt> data. Try the following (after running
<tt>poisson-melody</tt> above).</p>

<pre>
   (load &quot;midishow&quot;)
   (midi-show *seq*)
</pre>

<p>You will see a printout of the data inside the <tt>SEQ</tt> data object.
Unlike Midi, which stores note-on and note-off messages separately, the
<tt>SEQ</tt> structure saves notes as a single message that includes a
duration. This is translated to and from Midi format when you write and read
Midi files.</p>

<p>You can also examine a Midi file by calling:</p>

<pre>
   (midi-show-file &quot;demo.mid&quot;)
</pre>

<p>This function can take an optional second argument specifying an opened text
file if you want to write the data to a file rather than standard (console)
output:</p>

<pre>
   (midi-show-file &quot;demo.mid&quot; (open &quot;dump.txt&quot; :direction :output))
   (gc)
</pre>

<p>What is going on here? I did not save the opened file, but rather passed it
directly to <tt>midi-show-file</tt>. Therefore, I did not have a value to pass
to the <tt>close</tt> function. However, I know that files are closed by the
garbage collector when there are no more references to them, so I simply called
the garbage collector <tt>(gc)</tt> to run and close the file.</p>
