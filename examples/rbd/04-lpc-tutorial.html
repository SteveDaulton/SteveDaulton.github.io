<h1 align=center>Nyquist LPC Analysis and Synthesis</h1>

<br>

<p>Nyquist provides functions for LPC analysis and synthesis on streams of
audio data. For analysis, the audio stream is broken into successive frames,
each of which is analyzed, resulting in a small set of coefficients. For
synthesis, these frames control a time-varying filter which can be applied
to an audio signal.</p>

<p>As with FFT frames, Nyquist does not have a special data type corresponding
to a sequence of LPC frames. Instead, a sequence of frames is represented by
an XLISP object. Whenever you send the selector <tt>:next</tt> to the object,
you get back either NIL, indicating the end of the sequence, or you get an
LPC frame. (Note that FFT frames and LPC frames are not compatible.)</p>

<p>This tutorial is based on the file <tt>lpcdemo.lsp</tt> in the
<tt>demos</tt> folder fo the Nyquist release. Not every line is covered, but
this tutorial should give you a pretty full explanation of how to use LPC in
Nyquist.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>Before using LPC functions, you must load the LPC library:</p>

<pre>
   (load "lpc")
</pre>

<p>At the top of <tt>lpcdemo.lsp</tt>, you see the following lines:</p>

<pre>
   (setf *lpc-path* (current-path))
   (setf *lpc-data* (strcat *lpc-path* "lpc-exmpl.dat"))
</pre>

<p>The <tt>(current-path)</tt> function call returns the full file system
path to the file being loaded (<tt>lpcdemo.lsp</tt>). We save this into
<tt>*lpc-path*</tt> so we can find other related files later, even if the
current directory is changed. <tt>*lpc-data*</tt> is one of the file names we
will use later.</p>

<h2>LPC Analysis</h2>

<p>Another file we want is <tt>a-snd-file.snd</tt>, a very short vocal sound
that is part of the Nyquist release (it is also used by <tt>examples.lsp)</tt>.
To get this file, we concatenate it with the path we obtained above. The
resulting full path can be passed to <tt>s-read </tt>to read the sound.
Find the expressions in the following function that build a file name and
read the file as a sound:</p>

<pre>
   (defun do-lpc-analysis ()
     (let ((myfile (strcat *lpc-path* "a-snd-file.snd")))
       (save-lpc-file (make-lpanal-iterator (s-read *myfile*) 0.08 0.04 50)
                      "temp.dat")))
</pre>

<p>You can analyze a sound using <tt>make-lpanal-iterator</tt>. This function
takes a sound, a frame size, a step size, and the number of poles. In
<tt>do-lpc-analysis</tt> (above), we used 0.08 seconds, 0.04 seconds, and 50
poles for these parameters. The result of <tt>make-lpanal-iterator</tt> is an
object that will deliver LPC frames on demand. In this function, we will grab
all of the frames and write them to a file using <tt>save-lpc-file</tt>. The
data is written to <tt>"temp.dat"</tt>. You should run this function and look
at the file, which contains ASCII data. Later, we will use this data to filter
a sound.</p>

<p>Since <tt>a-snd-file.snd</tt> is a very short and uninteresting sound,
we will use a different set of LPC frames in the following synthesis examples.
The data is in <tt>lpc-exmpl.dat</tt>, and the full path for this file
was computed earlier and stored in <tt>*lpc-data*</tt>.</p>

<p>The first example will just show how to read the LPC data file using
<tt>make-lpc-file-iterator</tt>, which takes the file name as a parameter.
You can print some frame data using <tt>show-lpc-data</tt> as shown in the
following:</p>

<pre>
   (defun ex-1 ()&nbsp;
     (show-lpc-data (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*) 100 120 NIL))
</pre>

<p>The additional parameters to <tt>show-lpc-data</tt> are the starting frame
(100), the ending frame (120), and a flag (<tt>NIL</tt>)&nbsp; indicating
whether to print filter coefficients. If you want to look a little closer
at the inner workings of this code, you can send a <tt>:next</tt> message
to an LPC iterator object as follows:</p>

<pre>
   (setf iterator (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*))
   (send iterator :next)
</pre>

<p>This will return the first frame of the LPC analysis. Send <tt>:next</tt>
again&nbsp; to get the next frame.</p>

<h2>LPC Synthesis With Fixed All-Pole Filter</h2>

<p>The next example creates a sequence of vowel sounds. The vowel filters
are based on the 30th, 60th, and 100th frames taken from the file
<tt>lpc-exmpl.dat</tt>. We use <tt>make-lpc-file-iterator</tt> as before to
read the LPC frames from the file, but we use <tt>nth-frame</tt> to get the
desired frames.</p>

<p>The function <tt>allpoles-from-lpc</tt> constructs a filter from the
frame and applies it to a sound. In this case, the source sound is created
by <tt>buzz</tt> with a little vibrato provided by <tt>lfo</tt>:</p>

<pre>
   (defun ex-4 ()&nbsp;
     (play (seq
             (allpoles-from-lpc (buzz 12 f2 (lfo 5.0 4.0))&nbsp;
                                (nth-frame (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*)
                                           30))
             (allpoles-from-lpc (buzz 12 f2 (lfo 5.1 4.0))&nbsp;
                                (nth-frame (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*)
                                           60))
             (allpoles-from-lpc (buzz 12 g2 (lfo 5.3 4.0))&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                (nth-frame (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*)
                                           100)) )))
</pre>

<p>Rather than iterate through a file to find the desired frame, you can also
just store the desired frames as in the following:</p>

<pre>
   (setf a-lpcdata
     '(63.2144 0.674387 0.103287

</pre>

<p>The following function applies a filter to noise:</p>

<pre>
   (defun noise-vocal (lpcdata dur)
     (allpoles-from-lpc (noise dur) lpcdata))
</pre>

<p>Combining this with our definitions of different frames, we can write a
little sequence of vowel sounds:</p>

<pre>
   (defun ex-5 ()
     (play
       (seq (noise-vocal a-lpcdata 1)
            (noise-vocal e-lpcdata 1)
            (noise-vocal i-lpcdata 1))))
</pre>

<p>We can do the same thing using a buzz sound rather than noise:</p>

<pre>
   (defun buzz-vocal (lpcdata dur)
     (allpoles-from-lpc (buzz 16 e2 (const 0.0 dur))
                        lpcdata))
</pre>

<pre>
   (defun ex-6 ()
     (play
       (seq (buzz-vocal a-lpcdata 1)
            (buzz-vocal e-lpcdata 1)
            (buzz-vocal i-lpcdata 1))))
</pre>

<h2>Time-Varying LPC Filter</h2>

<p>The most interesting LPC effect is to use a sequence of frames to drive
a time-varying all-pole filter. If the frames were analyzed from a vocal
source, then the resulting filter will transfer the speech articulation
(or at least some of it) to another sound. The time-varying LPC filter
is called <tt>lpreson</tt>.</p>

<p>Here, the LPC data from <tt>*lpc-data*</tt> is used to modulate noise:</p>

<pre>
   (defun ex-7a ()
     ;; parameters are sound, lpc-iterator, skiptime
     (lpreson (noise 6.5) (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*) 0.04))
</pre>

<pre>
   (defun ex-7 ()
     (play (ex-7a)))
</pre>

<p>The same thing can be done to filter a buzz sound. This example generates
some vocal-like sounds in two-part harmony:</p>

<pre>
   (defun ex-8a (p dur)
</pre>

<pre>
   (lpreson (buzz 16 p (scale 1.5 (lfo 3.0 dur)))&nbsp;<br>
            (make-lpc-file-iterator *lpc-data*)
            0.04))
</pre>

<pre>
   (defun ex-8 ()
     (play
       (sim (seq (ex-8a c4 1) (ex-8a g3 1) (ex-8a a3 1) (ex-8a b3 1) (ex-8a c4 1))
            (seq (ex-8a c2 2) (ex-8a f2 1) (ex-8a g2 1) (ex-8a e2 1)))))
</pre>

<p>Note that you can change the <i>skiptime</i> parameter to <tt>lpreson</tt>
to change the rate at which the filter moves through the frames. The result
is to caues the speech articulations to go faster or slower.</p>

<p>More examples can be found in <tt>lpcdemo.lsp</tt>.</p>
