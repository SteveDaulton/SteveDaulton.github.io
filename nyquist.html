<h2>Nyquist, a Superset of XLisp</h2>

<p>
In Lisp (and therefore Nyquist), everything is an S-Expression, which is just
a list of tokens (words) separated by whitespace and enclosed in parentheses.
The name of the function is always the first token in an S-Expression, and all
of the other tokens are arguments to this function.  Here's a simple example:
</p>

<pre>
   (setf area (* 3.14159 (expt radius 2)))
</pre>

<p>Let's break down this example.  The outermost S-expression has three
members. The first one, <tt>setf</tt>, is the name of the function (it stands
for set-field).  <tt>setf</tt> is used to assign a value to a variable. (There
are other similar functions, like <tt>set</tt> and <tt>setq</tt>, but
<tt>setf</tt> is the most powerful, so it's the one we'll use in our examples.)
After <tt>setf</tt> comes <tt>area</tt>, which is the name of the variable
we're going to set.  Next comes the value to assign to this variable, which in
this case is another S-expression.</p>

<p>Lisp doesn't have any special operators for Math functions - they're all
functions like everything else, using <i>prefix</i> notation, where the name of
the function (or operator) come before its arguments. So instead of 3*7 for the
product of 3 and 7, in Lisp you would write (* 3 7). In Nyquist, the
<tt>expt</tt> (exponent) function raises its first argument to the power of the
second argument. Therefore <tt>(* 3.14159 (expt radius 2))</tt> means 3.14159
times the square of <tt>radius</tt>, or the formula for the area of a circle.
</p>

<p>Rather than typing in this full expression every time, let's define a
function for the area of the circle, that we can call every time we need it:
</p>

<pre>
   (defun circlearea (radius) (* 3.14159 (expt radius 2)))
</pre>

<p>The <tt>defun</tt> function is used to define a new function. The first
argument is the name of the function, in this case <tt>circlearea</tt>. The
second argument is a list of arguments to the function to be defined - this is
one of the few cases where you have an S-expression that is not interpreted as
a function call.  Finally the last expression is the value of the function.
Now if we want to compute the area of a circle of radius <tt>r</tt>, we just
need to compute:</p>

<pre>
   (setf area (circlearea r))
</pre>

<p>An S-expression is just a representation of a list. Lisp uses lists to
represent just about everything (the name LISP comes from LISt Processing
language), so it's helpful to know how to manipulate lists.  Let's start by
assigning a list of numbers to a variable.  You can't quite do this:</p>

<pre>
   (setf mylist (1 2 3 4 5))  <font color="#cc0000">&lt;--  error!</font>
</pre>

<p>The reason this doesn't work is that whenever Nyquist sees an S-expression,
it tries to evaluate it as a function unless you tell it otherwise. Since
there's no function named "1" that takes arguments <tt>(2 3 4 5)</tt>, this
will generate an error. To tell lisp that you want to treat an S-expression
literally, and not to evaluate it as a function, you <i>quote</i> it. In
Nyquist, you can quote a list by putting a single quotation mark before it,
like this:</p>

<pre>
   (setf mylist '(1 2 3 4 5))
</pre>

<p>Nyquist also provides a <tt>list</tt> function that you can use to construct
lists - this is useful if some of the elements of the list are functions:</p>

<pre>
   (setf mylist (list 1 2 3 4 (sqrt 25)))
</pre>

<p>To get things off of a list, you can use the <tt>first</tt> and
<tt>rest</tt> functions.  (Traditionally, these were called <tt>car</tt> and
<tt>cdr</tt>, respectively, but <tt>first</tt> and <tt>rest</tt> are much
easier to remember.  Both sets of names are supported in Nyquist.)  The output
of <tt>(first mylist)</tt> is 1, and the output of <tt>(rest mylist)</tt> is
the list <tt>(2 3 4 5)</tt>. So the second element of the list is <tt>(first
(rest mylist))</tt>.</p>

<a href="manual/home.html">Nyquist Reference Manual</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note: Symbols in Nyquist (like variable names and function names) are
not case sensitive.  They are converted to uppercase internally.</b></p>

<h2>Programming in Nyquist</h2>

<p>What makes Nyquist distinct from Lisp is that it is designed to work with
sound, and has lots of built-in primitives and functions that synthesize,
analyze, and manipulate sounds. Within Audacity, this makes it relatively easy
to build complicated effects out of Nyquist's palette of built-in functions.
</p>

<p>In Nyquist, a variable can hold a sound just as easily as it can hold a
number or a string. There are a lot of functions provided that allow you to
stretch, distort, and combine sounds very efficiently.  It is even possible to
"rip apart" a sound and access its individual samples, but that's beyond the
scope of this tutorial.</p>

<p><b>To try out a Nyquist expression in Audacity, you can use "Nyquist Prompt"
in the Effect menu.  Whatever audio you have selected will be in the variable
<tt>s</tt>, and the selection will be replaced with the result of the Nyquist
expression you enter.</b> Further down on this page you will learn how to
create a plug-in effect using Nyquist.</p>

<h2>Synthesizing</h2>

<p>The following functions all create new sounds. You can use them to create
"generate" plug-in effects, or you can combine these synthesized sounds with
selected audio to produce interesting effects.</p>

<table border="0"><tbody>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(noise)</tt></td><td>Generates white noise</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>(const value [duration])</tt></td><td>Generates a constant (silent)
signal</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(sine pitch [duration])</tt></td><td>Generates a sine
wave at an indicated pitch and duration. The pitch is a MIDI note number, with
60 for middle C.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(hzosc hz)</tt></td><td>Generates a sine wave at a
particular frequency in Hz.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(osc-saw hz)</tt></td><td>Generates a sawtooth wave at
a particular frequency in Hz.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(osc-tri hz)</tt></td><td>Generates a triangle wave at
a particular frequency in Hz.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(osc-pulse hz bias)</tt></td><td>Generates a square
pulse with variable width at the indicated frequency (in Hertz). The bias
parameter controls the pulse width and should be between -1 and +1, giving a
pulse width from 0% (always at -1) to 100% (always at +1). When bias is zero,
a square wave is generated.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(pluck pitch)</tt></td><td>Generates a sound at the
given pitch created using a modified Karplus-Strong plucked string algorithm.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Envelopes</h2>

<p>Nyquist has support for envelopes.  By applying an envelope to a sound, you
can control the overall shape of its amplitude. One of the easiest ways to
construct an envelope is with the <tt>env</tt> function, which takes 7
parameters that are commonly used for shaping synthesized musical notes: attack
time, decay time, release time, attack level, decay level, sustain level, and
overall duration.  See the figure below:</p>

<center>
<img src="images/nyquist-envelope.gif" height="200" width="467">
</center>

<p>To apply an envelope to a sound, just use the <tt>mult</tt> function. So if
<tt>s</tt> is a sound, then this is the sound with a simple envelope applied to
it:</p>

<pre>
   (mult s (env 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.0 0.5 0.3 1.0))
</pre>

<p>One of the most general type of envelope is a piece-wise linear function,
which can be constructed with the <tt>pwl</tt> function. The pwl function takes
a list of parameters which denote (time, value) pairs. There is an implicit
initial (time, value) pair of (0, 0), and an implicit final value of 0. There
should always be an odd number of parameters, since the final time is not
implicit. For example:</p>

<pre>
   ; symmetric rise to 0.7 (at time 1) and fall back to 0 (at time 2):
   (pwl 1.0 0.7 2.0)
</pre>

<h2>Combining sounds</h2>

<p>Besides multiplying two sounds with the <tt>mult</tt> function, you can add
two sounds (or envelopes) with the <tt>add</tt> function.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>Nyquist comes with a number of common filters built-in. Here are some of
the more common ones:</p>

<table border="0"><tbody>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(lp sound cutoff)</tt></td><td>Low-pass filter
(first-order Butterworth). Cutoff may be a float or a signal (for time-varying
filtering) and expresses hertz.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(hp sound cutoff)</tt></td><td>High-pass filter
(first-order Butterworth). Cutoff may be a float or a signal (for time-varying
filtering) and expresses hertz.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(comb sound hz decay)</tt></td><td>Applies a comb
filter to sound, which emphasizes (resonates at) frequencies that are multiples
of a hz.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(alpass sound decay hz)</tt></td><td>All-pass filter,
creating a delay effect without the resonances of a comb filter.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(notch2 sound hz)</tt></td><td>Second-order notch
filter centered at a frequency of hz.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Transforming and combining sounds</h2>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial to explain all of the
ways that a sound can be transformed in Nyquist. These functions do not modify
sounds directly, but instead modify the Nyquist <i>environment</i>. In order
for these changes to affect sounds, you must use the <tt>cue</tt> function.
</p>

<table border="0"><tbody>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(stretch factor (cue sound))</tt></td><td>Changes the
length of the sound being cued by the given factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(scale factor (cue sound))</tt></td><td>Scales the
amplitude of the sound being cued by the given factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(loud dB (cue sound))</tt></td><td>Increases or
decreases the volume of the sound being cued by the given number of decibels.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(at t (cue sound))</tt></td><td>Starts the given sound
at a particular time in seconds. This can't be used to add silence at the
beginning or end, but it can be used when combining two or more sounds.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(seq (cue s1) (cue s2))</tt></td><td>Creates a sequence
of sound s1 followed by sound s2.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="250"><tt>(sim (cue s1) (cue s2))</tt></td><td>Combines two
sounds so that they are played simultaneously.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Creating Nyquist plug-ins</h2>

<p>Creating a plug-in for Audacity using Nyquist is as simple as creating a
text file with the extension ".ny" with some Nyquist code, adding a few
comments to indicate the type of plug-in, and placing the file in Audacity's
<tt>plug-ins</tt> directory. Here's a very simple plug-in as an example:</p>

<pre>
   ;nyquist plug-in
   ;version 1
   ;type process
   ;name "Fade In"
   ;action "Fading In..."
   (mult (ramp) s)
</pre>

<p>The first two lines of a Nyquist plug-in must be exactly as in the example
above, or Audacity will not load it. (The version number is to support future
expansions of the plug-in format.) The next line is the type of plug-in, which
is discussed below. Then comes the name of the plug-in, which is what is
displayed in the menu bar, and then the "action", which is what Audacity
displays while it is busy processing the plug-in. There are other optional
lines that may follow. Any line that does not begin with a semicolon (;) is
assumed to contain Nyquist code and will be executed.</p>

<p>Audacity has support for three types of plug-ins that can be written in
Nyquist:</p>

<pre>
   ;type generate
   ;type process
   ;type analyze
</pre>

<p>These correspond to the three menus that can contain plug-ins: Generate,
Effect, and Analyze. Generate plug-ins are expected to generate new audio from
scratch, Effect plug-ins ("process") modify existing audio in-place, and
Analyze plug-ins process audio but do not modify it (though they are allowed
to add labels).</p>

<p>For Effect and Analyze plug-ins, Audacity sets up the Nyquist environment
so that the audio the user has selected is in the variable <tt>s</tt>. All of
the expressions in the plug-in file are executed in order, and the return value
of the last expression is substituted for the selection in Audacity. If the
last expression does not return audio, Audacity returns an error.</p>

<h2>Parameter dialogs</h2>

<p>Audacity has limited support for plug-ins showing a dialog to get parameters
from the user. Here is an example of a plug-in that opens a dialog:</p>

<pre>
   ;nyquist plug-in
   ;version 1
   ;type process
   ;name "Delay..."
   ;action "Performing Delay Effect..."
   ;info "Demo effect for Nyquist by Roger Dannenberg.\nThis effect 
      creates a fixed number of echos."  ; (should be all on one line)
   ;control decay "Decay amount" int "dB" 6 0 24
   ;control delay "Delay time" real "seconds" 0.5 0.0 5.0
   ;control count "Number of echos" int "times" 5 1 30

   (defun delays (s decay delay count)
     (if (= count 0) (cue s)
 	   (sim (cue s)
         (loud decay (at delay (delays s decay delay (- count 1)))))))
   (stretch-abs 1 (delays s (- 0 decay) delay count))
</pre>

<p>If Audacity finds at least one "control" line, it will open a dialog to
prompt the user for certain parameters to the plug-in. Each parameter consists
of a text box and a slider, and after the user has entered each one, the final
value will be stored in a Nyquist variable with a name that you specify on the
"control" line. Here's what the dialog for the Delay effect shown above looks
like in Audacity for Linux:</p>

<br><center>
<img src="images/delay_effect_dialog.png" height="221" width="414">
</center><br>

<p>Note that the "info" line is displayed at the top of the dialog, and that
the "\n" becomes a newline.  The parameters to the "control" line affect the
appearance and limitations of the parameter.  Each "control" line must consist
of exactly the following 8 elements, in order:</p>

<ol>
<li>The word "control"</li>
<li>The name of the control - this is the name of the Nyquist variable that
will get set when the user manipulates the dialog.</li>
<li>The label to the left of the control</li>
<li>The type of value: either <tt>int</tt> (integer) or <tt>real</tt>.</li>
<li>The label to the right of the value (usually the units like "Hz" or "dB").
</li>
<li>The default/initial value of the parameter</li>
<li>The minimum value of the parameter</li>
<li>The maximum value of the parameter</li>
</ol>

<h2>Returning labels</h2>

<p>Instead of returning audio, a Nyquist plug-in can instead return a list of
labels.  A list of labels is simply a list of time/label pairs, for example:
</p>

<pre>
   ((0.0 "start") (30.0 "middle") (60.0 "end"))
</pre>

<p>When a plug-in returns a list of exactly this form, Audacity will create a
new label track and add the labels at those positions.  This style of plug-in
is usually of type "analyze".</p>

<h2>Processing stereo tracks</h2>

<p>Nyquist represents stereo tracks as an array of sounds (not a list). Many
Nyquist functions automatically work with these arrays, but not all, so
sometimes you may find it necessary to split up a stereo array, or reassemble
one. Here are some useful functions:</p>

<table border="0"><tbody>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(arrayp s)</tt></td><td>returns true if <tt>s</tt> is
an array</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(aref s 0)</tt></td><td>the first element in array
<tt>s</tt> - the left channel</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(aref s 1)</tt></td><td>the second element in array
<tt>s</tt> - the right channel</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(setf s (make-array 2))</tt></td><td>makes <tt>s</tt>
into a new array of length 2</td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(setf (aref s 0) left)</tt></td><td>makes <tt>left</tt>
the first element of array <tt>s</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td width="220"><tt>(setf (aref s 1) right)</tt></td><td>makes
<tt>right</tt> the second element of array <tt>s</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>As a convenience, if the input to your Nyquist plug-in is stereo, but you
only output a single (mono) sound, Audacity will automatically copy it to both
the left and right channels.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

<p>Audacity comes with some sample plug-ins that you can examine or modify as
a starting point.  The best way to learn Nyquist is to try it. If you're having
trouble debugging, consider downloading the standalone version of Nyquist from
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~music/music.software.html">CMU
