<h2>1&nbsp; Programming Styles</h2>

<hr>

<p> There are many programming paradigms [models]. Some of the paradigms are
procedural, functional, rule-based, declarative and object-oriented. A
language can have aspects of one or many of these programming models. </p>

<p><b>Procedure-Oriented</b> - The programming paradigm most people are
familiar with is the procedural style. The primitives in procedural
programming are: subroutines and data structures. Through these primitives,
programmers have some limited abilities to share programs and program
fragments. C and Pascal are examples of procedural languages. Some
procedural languages [such as Modula and ADA] have extensions that provide
for better sharing of code.</p>

<p><b>Object-Oriented</b> - Object-oriented programming is based on the
primitives of objects, classes and messages. Objects are defined in terms of
classes. Actions occur by sending a message to an object. An object's
definition can be inherited from more general classes. Objective-C and C++
both are object-oriented dialects of the C language. Many dialects of LISP
have some object oriented extension [Flavors, Common LOOPS, CLOS and
others]. There currently is standards work proceeding to add object-oriented
programming to Common LISP.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2&nbsp; Object Oriented Programming</h2>

<hr>

<p>So, the object-oriented programming model is based around the concepts of
objects, classes and messages. An object is essentially a black box that
contains internal state information. You send an object a message which
causes the object to perform some operation. Objects are defined and
described through classes.</p>

<p>One aspect of an object is that you do not have to know what is inside or
how it works to be able to use it. From a programming point of view, this is
very handy. You can develop a series of objects for someone to use. If you
need to change what goes on inside, the users of the objects should be
unaware.</p>

<p>Another aspect of objects is that of inheritance. You can build up new
classes from existing classes by inheriting the existing class's
functionality and then extending the new definition. For example, you can
define a 'tool' class [with various attributes] and then go about creating
object instances 'tool-1', 'tool-2', and so on. You can also create new
sub-classes of the tool class like power-tool. This is also very handy
because you don't have to re-implement something if you can build it up from
existing code.</p>

<h2>3&nbsp; Xlisp Object Terminology</h2>

<hr>

<p>There are, as previously mentioned, many different languages with
object-oriented extensions and facilities. The terminology, operations and
styles of these are very different. Some of the main definitions for XLISP's
object-oriented extensions are:</p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>object data type</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The 'object' data type is a built-in data type of XLISP.
    Members of the object data type are object instances and classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>object instances</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">An 'object instance' is a composite structure that
    contains internal state information, methods (the code which respond
    to messages), a pointer to the object instance's defining class and
    a pointer to the object's super-class. XLISP contains no built-in
    object instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>class objects</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">A 'class object' is, essentially, the template for
    defining the derived object instances. A class object, although used
    differently from a simple object instance, is structurally a member of
    the object data type. It is also contains the linking mechanism that
    allows you to build class hierarchies (sub-classes and super-classes).
    XLISP contains two built-in class objects: 'object' and 'class'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>message selector</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The 'message selector' is the symbol that is used to
    select a particular action (Method) from the object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>message</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The 'message' is the combination of the message selector
    and the data (if any) to be sent to the object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>method</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The 'method' is the actual code that gets executed when
    the object receives the Message.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></p>

<h2>4&nbsp; Sending Messages</h2>

<hr>

<p>The mechanism for sending messages to XLISP objects is via the 'send'
function. It takes an object, a message selector and various optional
arguments [depending on the message selector].</p>

<p>The way that a user creates a new object is to send a ':new' message to a
previously defined class. The result of this 'send' will return an object, so
this is normally preceded by a 'setq'. The values shown in the examples that
follow may not match what you see if you try this on your version of XLISP,
this is not an error. The screens that are used in the various examples are
similar to what you should see on your computer screen. The '&gt;' is the
normal XLISP prompt [the characters that follow the prompt is what you
should type in to try these examples].</p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (setq my-object (send object :new))
#&lt;Object: #2e100&gt;
</pre>

<p> The object created here is of limited value. Most often, you create a
class object and then you create instances of that class. So in the
following example, a class called 'my-class' is created that inherits its
definition from the a built-in 'class' definition. Then two instances are
created of the new class. </p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (setq my-class (send class :new '()))
#&lt;Object: #27756&gt;

&gt; (setq my-instance (send my-class :new))
#&lt;Object: #27652&gt;

&gt; (setq another-instance (send my-class :new))
#&lt;Object: #275da&gt;
</pre>

<p><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to top</a></nobr></p>

<a name="5"></a>

<hr>

<h2>5&nbsp; Classes</h2>

<hr>

<p> Previously, a ':new' message was used to create an object. The message
used to see what is in an object is the ':show' message. </p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (send my-class :show)
Object is #&lt;Object: #27756&gt;, Class is #&lt;Object: #23fe2&gt;
  MESSAGES = NIL
  IVARS = NIL
  CVARS = NIL
  CVALS = NIL
  SUPERCLASS = #&lt;Object: #23fd8&gt;
  IVARCNT = 0
  IVARTOTAL = 0
#&lt;Object: #27756&gt;
</pre>

<p> From the display of the 'my-class' object you can see there are a
variety of components. The components of a class are: </p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>class pointer</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">This pointer shows to what class the object [instance or
    class] belongs. For a class, this always points to the built-in object
    'class'. This is also true of the 'class' object, its class pointer
    points to itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>superclass pointer</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">This pointer shows what the next class up the class
    hierarchy is. If the user does not specify what class is the superclass,
    it will point to the built-in class 'object'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>messages</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">This component shows what messages are allowed for the
    class, and the description of the method that will be used. If the
    method is system-defined, it will show up in the form of:

<pre class="example">
#&lt;Subr-: #18b98&gt;
</pre>

    Remember that the class hierarchy [through the Superclass Pointer] is
    searched if the requested message is not found in the class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>instance variables</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">This component lists what instance variables will be
    created when an object instance is created. If no instances of the class
    exist, there are no instance variables. If there are 5 instances of a
    class, there are 5 complete and different groups of the Instance
    Variables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>class variables<br>&nbsp;and values</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The 'class variables' [cvar] component lists what class
    variables exist within the class. The Class Values [cval] component
    shows what the current values of the variables are. Class Variables are
    used to hold state information about a class. There will be one of each
    of the Class Variables, independent of the number of instances of the
    class created.</td>
</tr>

<h2>6&nbsp; A Better Class Example</h2>

<hr>

<p> The example previously shown does work, but the class and instances created
don't really do anything of interest. The following example sets up a tool class
and creates some tool instances. </p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (setq my-tools (send class :new '(power moveable operation)))
#&lt;Object: #277a6&gt;

&gt; (send my-tools :answer :isnew '(pow mov op) 
                                '((setq power pow)
                                  (setq moveable mov)
                                  (setq operation op)))
#&lt;Object: #277a6&gt;

&gt; (setq drill (send my-tools :new 'AC t 'holes))
#&lt;Object: #2ddbc&gt;

&gt; (setq hand-saw (send my-tools :new 'none t 'cuts))
#&lt;Object: #2dc40&gt;

&gt; (setq table-saw (send my-tools :new 'AC nil 'cuts))
#&lt;Object: #2db00&gt;
</pre>

<p>So, a class of objects called 'my-tools' was created. Note that the class
object 'my-tools' was created by sending the ':new' message to the built-in
'class' object. Within the 'my-tool' class, there are three instances called
'drill', 'hand-saw' and 'table-saw'. These were created by sending the
':new' message to the 'my-tools' class object. Notice that the parameters
followed the message selector.</p>

<p><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to top</a></nobr></p>

<a name="7"></a>

<hr>

<h2>7&nbsp; Instances</h2>

<hr>

<p>The following is a display of the contents of some of the previously
created instances:</p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (send drill :show)
Object is #&lt;Object: #2ddbc&gt;, Class is #&lt;Object: #277a6&gt;
  POWER = AC
  MOVEABLE = T
  OPERATION = HOLES
#&lt;Object: #2ddbc&gt;

&gt; (send hand-saw :show)
Object is #&lt;Object: #2dc40&gt;, Class is #&lt;Object: #277a6&gt;
  POWER = NONE
  MOVEABLE = T
  OPERATION = CUTS
#&lt;Object: #2dc40&gt;
</pre>

<p> From the display of these instances you can see there are some
components and values. The components of an instance are: </p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>class pointer</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">This pointer shows to which class the current object
    instance belongs. It is through this link that the system finds the
    methods to execute for the received messages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>instance variables<br>&nbsp;and values</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The instance variables [ivar] component lists what
    variables exist within the instance. The instance values component holds
    what the current values of the variables are. Instance Variables are
    used to hold state information for each instance. There will be a group
    of Instance Variables for each instance.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to top</a></nobr></p>

<a name="8"></a>

<hr>

<h2>8&nbsp; Methods</h2>

<hr>

<p> There have been a few of the messages and methods in XLISP shown to this
point [':new' and ':show']. The following are the methods built into XLISP:
</p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>:answer</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The ':answer' method allows you to define or change
    methods within a class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>:class</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The ':class' method returns the class of an object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>:isnew</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The ':isnew' method causes an instance to run its
    initialization code. When the ':isnew' method is run on a class, it
    resets the class state. This allows you to re-define instance variables,
    class variables, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>:new</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The ':new' method allows you to create an instance when
    the ':new' message is sent to a user-defined class. The ':new' method
    allows you to create a new class (when the ':new' message is sent to the
    built-in 'class').</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><nobr><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></nobr></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td nowrap><nobr><b>:show</b></nobr></td>
  <td nowrap><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</nobr></td>
  <td width="100%">The ':show' method displays the instance or class.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></p>

<hr>

<h2>9&nbsp; Sending Messages To A Superclass</h2>

<hr>

<p> In addition to the 'send' function, there is another function called
'send-super'. The 'send-super' function causes the specified message to be
performed by the superclass method. This is a mechanism to allow chaining of
methods in a class hierarchy. This chaining behavior can be achieved by
creating a method for a class with the ':answer' message. Within the body of
the method, you include a 'send-super' form. This function is allowed only
inside the execution of a method of an object. </p>

<p><nobr>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to top</a></nobr></p>

<a name="10"></a>

<hr>

<h2>10&nbsp; Object And Class</h2>

<hr>

<p>The definition of the built-in class 'object' is:</p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (send object :show)
Object is #&lt;Object: #23fd8&gt;, Class is #&lt;Object: #23fe2&gt;
  MESSAGES = ((:SHOW . #&lt;Subr-: #23db2&gt;) 
              (:CLASS . #&lt;Subr-: #23dee&gt;) 
              (:ISNEW . #&lt;Subr-: #23e2a&gt;))
  IVARS = NIL
  CVARS = NIL
  CVALS = NIL
  SUPERCLASS = NIL
  IVARCNT = 0
  IVARTOTAL = 0
#&lt;Object: #23fd8&gt;
</pre>

<p> Note that 'object' is a class, as opposed to an 'instance-style' object.
'object' has no superclass, it is the top or root of the class hierarchy. 'object's
class is 'class'. </p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; (send class :show)
Object is #&lt;Object: #23fe2&gt;, Class is #&lt;Object: #23fe2&gt;
  MESSAGES = ((:ANSWER . #&lt;Subr-: #23e48&gt;) 
              (:ISNEW . #&lt;Subr-: #23e84&gt;) 
              (:NEW . #&lt;Subr-: #23ea2&gt;))
  IVARS = (MESSAGES IVARS CVARS CVALS SUPERCLASS 
           IVARCNT IVARTOTAL)
  CVARS = NIL
  CVALS = NIL
  SUPERCLASS = #&lt;Object: #23fd8&gt;
  IVARCNT = 7
  IVARTOTAL = 7
#&lt;Object: #23fe2&gt;
</pre>

<p>'class' has a superclass of 'object'. It's class is itself, 'class'.</p>
